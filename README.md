# Custom Countdown

Countdown project, the user has the option to enter what he wants to count down to and select the date.  
The design is responsive, so it also scales on mobile devices.   
The project uses locale storage, so it remembers the settings of what the user wants to count down to and restores the countdown when the page is reloaded.
